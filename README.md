# hello-world.
my first repository

I am 32 and for the first time am trying this and am commited to learn basic programing and if I really like it, I might become a programer, initially my plan is to understand better how things work here since am starting to get very involved in the blockchain, by the way am a electromechaninc engineer and always pasionated about control.
